[COMMIT 198]

Licenses for the following files are being changed due to misleading authorship:
	- CafePQ NPCs: those NPC script files were not around on OdinMS server, neither before HeavenMS.
	- GuildQuest.js: that event script file was completely rewritten to suit well the underlying EIM of HeavenMS.
	- Custom NPCs 9000017, 9000036, 9000041: those NPC script files were not around on OdinMS server, neither on Solaxia.

Original dates are summarized on the subfolders, for steadfast conference.

Licenses for the following files are being added:
	- Several PQs and boss battles: those event scripts are authored by myself, all following similar pattern and using
common functions introduced on this server (such as getEligibleParty, startEventTimer or isEventTeamLackingNow).

I am expecting no infringements from this action, should any issues arise contact me asap.
